The online reservation system is a simple console-based application that allows users to make, view, and cancel reservations. I used the following components to build the system: Reservation Class, Reservation System Class and User Interface. Reservation class will represent a reservation and will have properties like name, date, and number of guests. This class consists of methods for name, ID, date etc. ‘this’ keyword is used to get reference of running class. Reservation System class will manage the reservations and will have methods for making a reservation, getting all reservations, getting a reservation by ID, and cancelling a reservation. Array list  has been used in this class to make things simple for adding reservation using ‘add’ function and deleting reservations with ‘remove’ function. User Interface will be a simple console-based interface that allows users to interact with the reservation system. For taking the inputs from user, I used the scanner class. In while loop all the options have been mentioned as – Make a reservation, view all reservations, Cancel a reservation and Exit. Reservations can simply be made by giving information of user and calling the make reservation method. It will return output as reservation ID. Cancelling of reservation is take place by ID. It will delete reservation of given ID. Summing up all the things, OOPS and some basic java concepts are the core of this system.
